## Organization &#129428;

Welcome to follow **dishait**

- [Official Website](http://dishaxy.dishait.cn/)

- [NetEase Cloud Classroom](https://study.163.com/provider/480000001892585/index.htm?share=2&shareId=480000001892585)
  <br />
  <br />

## Details &#128051;

### [1. Vite](https://cn.vitejs.dev/)

This template uses **[Vite](https://cn.vitejs.dev/)** as the build tool. You can
configure the project's build in `vite.config.ts` at the root directory.

For the introduction of many mainstream plugins and complex configurations, they
have been integrated into the presets under the root directory. In most cases,
you do not need to reconfigure them.

<br />

### [2. Vue3](https://v3.cn.vuejs.org/)

<br />

### [3. File-based Routing](https://github.com/posva/unplugin-vue-router)

The directory structure is the route.

For example:

- `src/pages/index.vue` => `/`
- `src/pages/about.vue` => `/about`
- `src/pages/users/index.vue` => `/users`
- `src/pages/users/profile.vue` => `/users/profile`
- `src/pages/users/[id].vue` => `/users/:id`
- `src/pages/[user]/settings.vue` => `/:user/settings`
- `src/pages/[...notFound].vue` => 404 route

For more details, please refer to
[unplugin-vue-router](https://github.com/posva/unplugin-vue-router).

<br />

### [4. Layout System](https://github.com/dishait/vite-plugin-vue-meta-layouts)

#### Default Layout

`src/layouts/default.vue` will be used as the default layout.

```html
<!-- src/layouts/default.vue -->
<template>
    default
    <router-view />
    <!-- Page view outlet -->
</template>
```

At this point, `src/pages/index.vue`:

```html
<!-- src/pages/index.vue -->
<template>
    <div>home</div>
</template>
```

When routing to `/`, the page will render:

```html
default home
```

Now, `src/pages/about.vue`:

```html
<!-- src/pages/about.vue -->
<template>
    <div>about</div>
</template>
```

When routing to `/about`, the page will render:

```html
default about
```

<br />

#### Non-Default Layout

Create a `src/layouts/custom.vue` randomly:

```html
<!-- src/layouts/custom.vue -->
<template>
    custom
    <router-view />
    <!-- Page view outlet -->
</template>
```

At this point, in `src/pages/index.vue`:

```html
<!-- src/pages/index.vue -->
<template>
    <div>home</div>
</template>

<!-- Add custom block &#128071; -->
<route lang="json">
{
    "meta": {
        "layout": "custom"
    }
}
</route>
```

When routing to `/`, the page will render:

```html
custom home
```

See specifically &#128073;
[vite-plugin-vue-meta-layouts](https://github.com/dishait/vite-plugin-vue-meta-layouts)

<br />

### [5. Mock Support](https://github.com/vbenjs/vite-plugin-mock)

In the `mock` directory under the root directory, you can export default `api`
resources in modules.

For example, export from `mock/test.ts`:

```ts
import { MockMethod } from "vite-plugin-mock";
export default [
  {
    url: "/api/mock/get",
    method: "get",
    response: () => {
      return {
        code: 0,
        data: {
          name: "vben",
        },
      };
    },
  },
] as MockMethod[];
```

You can then make mock requests in the `src` directory.

```html
<template>
  <div>data: {{data}}</div>
  <div>loading: {{loading}}</div>
  <div>error: {{error}}</div>
</template>
```

Here we use [vue-request](https://cn.attojs.org/) to make requests, but since
this `mock` intercepts an entire interface, it is also possible to use request
libraries such as `axios`.

<br />

### [6. Api Auto Import](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-auto-import)

The original `vue` `api` needs to be manually `import`ed.

```ts
import { computed, ref } from "vue";
const count = ref(0);
const doubled = computed(() => count.value * 2);
```

Now it can be directly used.

```ts
const count = ref(0);
const doubled = computed(() => count.value * 2);
```

And the above `api` is automatically imported on demand.

Currently, the template supports automatic import of libraries that support
auto-importing `api`.

- `vue`
- `vuex`
- `pinia`
- `vue-i18n`
- `vue-router`
- `@vueuse/core`
- `@vueuse/head`
- `@vueuse/math`

Just make sure to install the dependencies and see the specific details here
&#128073;
[vite-auto-import-resolvers](https://github.com/dishait/vite-auto-import-resolvers#%E9%BB%98%E8%AE%A4%E6%94%AF%E6%8C%81%E5%88%97%E8%A1%A8),

Of course, there are also automatic imports in projects, just need to meet the
following specifications.

1. The export from `src/composables` will be automatically imported as needed.

For example, there is a `src/composables/foo.ts` file:

```ts
// default export
export default 1000;
```

1. No need for `import` at this point.

```html
<script setup lang="ts">
	console.log(foo) // output 1000
</script>

<template>
  <div @click="store.inc()">{{store.counter}}</div>
</template>
```

2. The export from `src/stores` will be automatically imported as needed.

For example, there is a `src/stores/counterStore.ts` file:

```ts
// default export
export default defineStore("counter", {
  state() {
    return {
      counter: 1,
    };
  },
  actions: {
    inc() {
      this.counter++;
    },
  },
});
```

At this point, there is no need for `import` anymore.

```html
<script setup lang="ts">
	const store = counterStore()
</script>

<template>
	<div @click="store.inc()">{{store.counter}}</div>
</template>
```

3. `src/api` is also automatically imported on demand, similar to the above.

You can see more details in the
[unplugin-auto-import](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-auto-import)
documentation.

<br />

### [7. Automatic component importing](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-vue-components)

It turns out that `import` is required.

```html
<!-- src/pages/index.vue -->
<script setup lang="ts">
	import Hello from '../components/Hello.vue'
</script>

<template>
	<Hello />
</template>
```

Now, any components defined in the `src/components` directory will be
automatically imported on demand, meaning that `import` statements are not
required.

```html
<!-- src/pages/index.vue -->
<template>
	<Hello />
</template>
```

Of course, it also supports nested components, such as
`src/components/foo/bar.vue` &#128071;

```html
<!-- src/pages/index.vue -->
<template>
	<FooBar />
</template>
```

Automatic importing of popular component libraries is also supported, such as
`Naive ui`.

You only need to install the dependency.

```shell
pnpm add naive-ui
```

Then you can use it in your templates.

```html
<!-- src/pages/index.vue -->
<template>
	<n-button type="success">Success</n-button>
</template>
```

Currently supported component libraries are:

- [vant](https://github.com/youzan/vant)
- [idux](https://github.com/IDuxFE/idux)
- [devui](https://github.com/DevCloudFE/vue-devui)
- [quasar](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar)
- [varlet](https://github.com/varletjs/varlet)
- [inkline](https://github.com/inkline/inkline)
- [vuetify](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify)
- [naive-ui](https://github.com/TuSimple/naive-ui)
- [primevue](https://github.com/primefaces/primevue)
- [layui-vue](https://gitee.com/layui/layui-vue)
- [view-design](https://iviewui.com/)
- [arco-design](https://github.com/arco-design/arco-design)
- [element-plus](https://github.com/element-plus/element-plus)
- [ant-design-vue](https://github.com/vueComponent/ant-design-vue)
- [@headlessui/vue](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/headlessui)
- [tdesign-vue-next](https://github.com/Tencent/tdesign-vue-next)
- [@vueuse/components](https://github.com/vueuse/vueuse/tree/main/packages/components)

Please refer to 👉
[unplugin-vue-components](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-vue-components)

<br />

### [8. Automatic icon importing](https://unocss.dev/presets/icons)

You can go to [icones](https://icones.netlify.app/) and click on any icon
library you like.

![icons-first-step](public/docs/icons-first-step.png)

Then click on one of the icons you like.

![icons-second-step](public/docs/icons-second-step.png)

Copy its name.

![icons-third-step](public/docs/icons-third-step.png)

In the template, you can use it directly through the `class` method, remember to
add the prefix `i-`.

```html
<template>
	<div class="i-mdi:account-box-multiple"></div>
</template>
```

After saving, wait for the automatic download of theAfter saving, wait for the
automatic download of the icon library and you can see the corresponding icon in
the page.

I also recommend using the `vscode` plugin
[Iconify IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=antfu.iconify).

This plugin displays a preview of the icons in the template.

Of course, dynamic loading of icons is also supported:

```html
<script>
	const icon = ref("i-ep:arrow-left")

	// Change to another icon after two seconds.
	setTimeout(() => {
		icon.value = 'i-icon-park-outline:arrow-circle-down'
	}, 2000)
</script>

<template>
	<div :class="icon"></div>
</template>
```

Please note that for dynamic icons, make sure to test all the icons in the
development environment.

For more information, please refer to
[unocss/presets/icons](https://unocss.dev/presets/icons).

<br />

### [9. VueUse Support](https://vueuse.org/)

`VueUse` is a powerful `hooks` library. For example, if you want to get the
mouse position, you only need to do this:

```html
<script setup lang="ts">
	// The `useMouse` hook is automatically imported on demand, so thereThe `useMouse` hook is automatically imported on demand, so there's no need for an `import` statement.
	const { x, y } = useMouse()
</script>

<template>
	<div>x {{x}}</div>
	<div>y {{y}}</div>
</template>
```

Please refer to 👉 [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/)

<br />

### [10. TypeScript's](https://www.tslang.cn/)

You don't need to reconfigure, just write it in `ts` directly.

<br />

### [11. unocss's](https://unocss.dev/)

`unocss` is a faster development `atomic CSS` library.

You can use it directly in the template, no configuration is needed.

```html
<template>
	<div class="bg-red-500 text-white">I am white text on a red background.</div>
</template>
```

The above template will render white text on a red background.

It also supports [attribute mode](https://unocss.dev/presets/attributify), which
means you can use shorthand notation.

```html
<template>
	<div text="white" bg="red-500">I am white text on a red background.</div>
</template>
```

This can reduce the amount of code when adjusting margin sizes, among other
things.

For more information, please refer to [unocss](https://unocss.dev/).

<br />

### [12. Dark mode support](https://github.com/dishait/vue-dark-switch)

Dark mode is implemented by
[vue-dark-switch](https://github.com/dishait/vue-dark-switch).

```html
<script setup>
import { SwitchIcon } from "vue-dark-swicth"
</script>

<template>
	<!-- Dark switch, one-click to switch to dark mode. -->
	<SwitchIcon /> 
</template>
```

Please refer to 👉 [vue-dark-switch](https://github.com/dishait/vue-dark-switch)

<br />

### [13. SWR Request Support](https://cn.attojs.org/)

SWR is a more modern way of making requests, for more information please refer
to the article &#128073; [SWR](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/89570321).

And [vue-request](https://cn.attojs.org/) is a Vue version request library for
SWR.

You can use it like this, for example, to request `/api/test`

```html
<script setup lang="ts">
	import { useRequest } from 'vue-request'
	const { data, loading, error } = useRequest('/api/test')
</script>

<template>
	<div>data: {{data}}</div>
	<div>error: {{error}}</div>
	<div>loading: {{loading}}</div>
</template>
```

All the basic data, state, and caching are handled for you, so there's no need
to re-wrap things.

For more information, please refer to [vue-request](https://cn.attojs.org/).

<br />

### [14. Pinia State Management](https://pinia.vuejs.org/)

`Pinia` is the next-generation state management library, which is simpler than
`Vuex` and has better TypeScript support.

You can define your states in the `src/stores` directory.

For example, create a `src/stores/counter.ts` file:

```ts
// src/stores/counter.ts
import { defineStore } from "pinia";

export const useCounterStore = defineStore("counter", {
  state() {
    return { count: 0 };
  },
  actions: {
    inc() {
      this.count++;
    },
  },
});
```

After defining it, you can use it directly in the `setup`.

```html
<!-- src/pages/index.vue -->
<script setup lang="ts">
    const Counter = useCounterStore()
<script>

<template>
    <div @click="Counter.inc">{{Counter.count}}</div>
</template>
```

For more specific usage, please refer to [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/).

<br />

### [15. pnpm Package Manager](https://pnpm.io/zh/)

`pnpm` is an excellent package manager that is faster, more space-efficient, and
more reasonable.

For more information, please refer to [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/zh/).
<br />

### [16. Jumping progress bar support](https://github.com/rstacruz/nprogress)

The jumping progress bar is implemented by `nprogress`, and you can adjust the
color scheme in `src/styles/main.css`.

```css
/** src/styles/main.css **/

/** Omit other styles. **/
#nprogress .bar {
	@apply bg-blue-700 bg-opacity-75; /** color **/

	position: fixed;
	z-index: 1031;
	top: 0;
	left: 0;

	width: 100%;
	height: 2px;
}
```

About `@apply`, it is implemented by
[@unocss/transformer-directives](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@unocss/transformer-directives).

For more information, please refer to &#128073;
[nprogress](https://github.com/rstacruz/nprogress).

<br />

[17. Development panel support](https://github.com/webfansplz/vite-plugin-vue-devtools)

This panel allows you to understand various aspects of the project during
development, and it is currently only effective in the development environment.

For more information, please refer to
[vite-plugin-vue-devtools](https://github.com/webfansplz/vite-plugin-vue-devtools).

<br />

### [18. Plugin auto-loading support](https://github.com/dishait/vite-plugin-use-modules)

You only need to export the default function in the module located in
`src/plugins`.

For example, with `pinia`, you only need to do this:

```ts
// src/plugins/pinia.ts
// Export the default interface
export default createPinia(); // pinia will be automatically installed
```

Or with `vue-router`:

```ts
// src/plugins/router.ts
// Omit various configurations

// Export the default interface
export default router; // The router will be automatically installed
```

Of course, `pinia` and `vue-router` are already preset, so you don't need to
worry about them again.

For more information, please refer to
[vite-plugin-use-modules](https://github.com/dishait/vite-plugin-use-modules).

<br />

### [19. Vitest Unit Testing Support](https://vitest.dev/guide/#configuring-vitest)

You can write unit tests in the `src/test` directory.

```ts
import { assert, describe, expect, it } from "vitest";

describe("suite name", () => {
  it("foo", () => {
    expect(1 + 1).toEqual(2);
    expect(true).to.be.true;
  });

  it("bar", () => {
    assert.equal(Math.sqrt(4), 2);
  });

  it("snapshot", () => {
    expect({ foo: "bar" }).toMatchSnapshot();
  });
});
```

Then you can run the tests by entering the following command in the terminal:

```shell
pnpm test
```

Or generate a report:

```shell
pnpm coverage
```

For more information, please refer to
[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/guide/#configuring-vitest).

<br />

### [20. Markdown rendering support](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-vue-markdown)

Markdown rendering can be used to write some simple instructions.

You only need to change the file extension of pages in the `src/pages` directory
from `.vue` to `.md`, and then modify it to use markdown syntax.

For example, `src/pages/about.md`:

```md
## About Page

> The page is a markdown file
```

When you route to `/about`, you can see the corresponding markdown rendering.

Of course, it also supports embedding Vue components in markdown.

For more information, please refer to
[unplugin-vue-markdown](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-vue-markdown).

<br />

### 21. Path Alias Support

The `~` or `@` path will be directed to the `src` directory of the project,
while providing better type hinting.

```html
<!-- src/pages/index.vue -->
<script lang="ts" setup>
	import { useDarks } from '~/composables/dark'

	// Is equivalent to
	// import { useDarks } from "../composables/dark"
</script>
```

<br />
<br />

### 22. Command Line Auto Create and Remove

To create a standard page or component just enter &#128071;，

```shell
pnpm auto:create
```

Of course, you can also delete &#128071;，

```shell
pnpm auto:remove
```

<br />
<br />

### [23. i18n Internationalization Support](https://github.com/intlify/bundle-tools/tree/main/packages/vite-plugin-vue-i18n)

In daily business, there may be some scenarios that require
internationalization. Then you only need to define different languages' `yml` in
the `locales` directory at the root level to achieve out-of-the-box
internationalization support in the project.

For example, `locales/en.yml` is used to define the English content that
requires internationalization support.

```yml
# locales/en.yml
# English

index: index
about: about
not-found: Notfound
```

For example, `locales/简体中文.yml` is used to define the Chinese content that
requires internationalization support.

```yml
# locales/简体中文.yml
# 中文

index: 主页
about: 关于
not-found: 未找到页面
```

You can use it in components like this at this time &#128071;

```html
<script setup>
	// This API is globally imported on demand, so it can be used directly.
	// t is used to bind specific language blocks.
	const { t, locale } = useI18n()

	const toggleLocale = () => {
		// locale.value is used to represent the current language, and it can be modified for language switching.
		locale.value = locale.value === '简体中文' ? 'en' : '简体中文'
	}
</script>

<template>
	<div m="6" cursor="pointer" @click="toggleLocale()">
		language: {{ t('index') }} click me!!
	</div>
</template>

### 24. Beautiful `404` Page Support

In daily business, when a user visits a non-existent page, they should be given
an information prompt that the page does not exist, and this prompt page is the
`404` page.

You can visit any non-existent page at random, for example `/bucunzai`

![notFound](public/docs/notFound.png)

Of course, there is also dark mode adaptation.

![notFound-dark](public/docs/notFound-dark.png)

It also supports simple responsive adaptation. For example, it will display
correctly on mobile browsers.

If the cover of this `404` page does not meet your taste, you can modify the
`src` attribute of the `img` tag in `pages/[...notFound].vue`. The default is
`32.svg`, supporting `1 ~ 33` `svg`.

For example, the default is:

```html
<!-- Omitting various codes -->
<template>
	<img src="/notFound/32.svg" class="cover" alt="page not found" />
</template>
```

To change the cover to `/notFound/33.svg`, modify it as follows:

```html
<!-- Omitting various codes-->
<template>
	<img src="/notFound/33.svg" class="cover" alt="page not found" />
</template>
```

This will switch the cover to:

![notFound-other](public/docs/notFound-other.png)

<br />
<br />

### 25. [`tsx` Support](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/plugin-vue-jsx)

You only need to place the `.tsx` file under `src/components`, and you can
directly use it in the template.

For example, if you have a `src/components/foo.tsx` file, you can directly use
it in the template.

```tsx
// src/components/foo.tsx
export default defineComponent({
  render() {
    return <div>Test</div>;
  },
});
```

```html
<template>
	<foo />
</template>
```

For more details, please refer to:
[@vitejs/plugin-vue-jsx](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/plugin-vue-jsx)

<br />
<br />

### 26. [`gzip` Resource Compression Support](https://github.com/vbenjs/vite-plugin-compression)

Out-of-the-box `gzip` resource compression in production environment, no
configuration required.

For more details, please refer to:
[vite-plugin-compression](https://github.com/vbenjs/vite-plugin-compression)

<br />
<br />

### 27. [Environment Variable Configuration Support](https://cn.vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html)

The `.env` file in the root directory is used to configure environment variables
for the project.

<br />
<br />

### 28. Unified Code Standards and Style Support

Code style verification provided by [eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint)
and code standardization using [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier).

Provided by [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) +
[lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) during `commit`
verification.

<br />
<br />

### 29. [Automatic Removal of Development Logs in Production Environment](https://github.com/dishait/vite-plugin-removelog)

In the production environment, logs such as `console.log`, `console.warn`, and
`console.error` will be automatically removed to avoid the leakage of
development logs.

For more details, please refer to:
[vite-plugin-removelog](https://github.com/dishait/vite-plugin-removelog)

<br />
<br />

### 30. [defineOptions Support](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#defineoptions)

```html
<script setup lang="ts">
	// Define additional options
	defineOptions({
		name: 'Foo',
	})
</script>
```

<br />
<br />

### 31. [Echarts Support](https://github.com/ecomfe/vue-echarts)

A simple integration with [vue-echarts](https://github.com/ecomfe/vue-echarts),
please refer to the documentation of
[echarts](https://github.com/apache/echarts) and
[vue-echarts](https://github.com/ecomfe/vue-echarts).

<br />
<br />

### 32. [Global Toast Notification](https://github.com/euvl/vue-notification)

Integrated with [vue-toastification](https://github.com/euvl/vue-notification),
you can use it in all files under the `src` directory:

```ts
// Any file under the `src` directory is available.
toast.info("info");
toast.error("error");
toast.warning("warning");
toast.success("success");
```

For more details, please refer to:
[Global Toast Notification](https://github.com/euvl/vue-notification)

<br />
<br />

### 33. [Global Axios Request Wrapper](https://www.axios-http.cn/)

The [axios](https://www.axios-http.cn/) is wrapped, and you can use it in all
files under the `src` directory:

```ts
// Available in any file under src
http.get("...");
http.post("...", { name: "张三", age: 20 });
// ... and so on
```

The above `http` is an instance created separately by `axios`, with simple error
prompts and response data conversion. For more details, please refer to
`src/composables/http.ts`.

If you prefer a reactive style and `swr`, you can use it together with
[vue-request](https://github.com/attojs/vue-request).

```ts
import { useRequest } from "vue-request";

const { data, error, loading } = useRequest(() => http.get("..."));

loading.value; // loading

error.value; // error

data.value; // data
```

The `http` instance's `baseURL` takes the value from the environment variable
file `.env` for `VITE_API_BASE_URL`, defaulting to `/api`, which can be changed
according to your needs.

For more details, please refer to &#128073; [axios](https://www.axios-http.cn/).

<br />
<br />

### 34. [Automatic Generation of Environment Variable Type Declarations](https://github.com/dishait/vite-plugin-env-types)

In Vite projects, we can set environment variables in `.env` and use them in the
frontend source code through `import.meta.env`, but the type hinting is poor.
This feature can automatically generate type declarations to achieve real-time
type hinting, so you don't need to worry about and manage them manually.

For more details, please refer to:
[vite-plugin-env-types](https://github.com/dishait/vite-plugin-env-types).

<br />
<br />

### 35. [`renovate` Automatically Updates Dependencies](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate)

The [renovate](https://github.com/marketplace/renovate) bot on GitHub will
periodically check dependencies on GitHub and raise a `pr` to update the
repository, with the update strategy available at:
[unjs/renovate-config](https://github.com/unjs/renovate-config).

Of course, you can also manually execute it to update:

```shell
pnpm deps:fresh
```

For more details, please refer to:
[renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate)

<br />
<br />

### 36. [Automatic Version Update and Generating `CHANGELOG`](https://github.com/unjs/changelogen)

When we execute `pnpm run release`, it will automatically update the version and
update the `CHANGELOG.md` file.

For more details, please refer to:
[unjs/changelogen](https://github.com/unjs/changelogen).

<br />
<br />

### 37. [Fastest and Smallest `dockerfile` for Static `go` Service](https://github.com/PierreZ/goStatic)

The `dockerfile` in the root directory configures the smallest and fastest
container for a static `go` service, making it more convenient for cloud
container services.

For more details, please refer to:
[PierreZ/goStatic](https://github.com/PierreZ/goStatic).

<br />
<br />

### 38. Base Secure Path Resolution

In Vite, if we change the `base` in `vite.config.ts`, it causes the resource
paths and route paths to become invalid. Using `safeResolve` can ensure that the
same `base` is used in both development and production environments.

```html
<script setup lang="ts">
const path = safeResolve("your route path")
</script>

<template>
	<!-- Applications in templates are also allowed. -->
	<img :src="safeResolve('/notFound/32.svg')"/>
</template>
```

<br />
<br />

### 39. `lightningcss` Support

Now it will automatically detect whether the current project supports
[lightningcss](https://cn.vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#lightning-css) and
enable it intelligently.

<br />
<br />

### 40. Vite Config Layer Support (Experimental)

Now in `tov-template`, we can use the form of `vite.config.[mode].ts` to support
configuration files for different environments.

1. Only vite.config.ts is selected when there is no specific mode.
2. When both vite.config.ts and vite.config.dev.ts exist, their configurations
   are merged during development, with the configuration in vite.config.dev.ts
   having higher priority.
3. When both vite.config.ts and vite.config.prod.ts exist, their configurations
   are merged during production, with the configuration in vite.config.prod.ts
   having higher priority.

This feature is supported by
[vite-layers](https://github.com/markthree/vite-layers).
